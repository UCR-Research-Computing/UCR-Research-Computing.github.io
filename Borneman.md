**Allocation Review Committee Report: Borneman Lab - Microbial Transcriptome Analysis**

**Executive Summary:**

The Borneman Lab requests an extension of their GCP allocation for eight weeks to refine their analysis of the citrus microbial transcriptome.  This project builds upon previous work, aiming to develop a more robust pipeline for identifying complete microbial genomes, particularly those relevant to citrus health. The anticipated outcome is a deeper understanding of the citrus microbiome, contributing to potential solutions for diseases like Huanglongbing (HLB).

**Narrative Story:**

Citrus greening disease, or HLB, poses a significant threat to the citrus industry.  Understanding the complex interplay between the citrus tree, its microbiome, and the HLB pathogen is crucial for developing effective disease management strategies. The Borneman Lab's research focuses on deciphering this intricate relationship by analyzing the citrus microbial transcriptome.  Their initial work identified promising microbial candidates. This project proposes to refine their analysis pipeline, allowing for the reconstruction of more complete microbial genomes.  This enhanced resolution will significantly improve the identification and characterization of key microbes, potentially uncovering novel targets for HLB mitigation.

**Estimated Value:**

The value of this project lies in its potential to contribute to solutions for HLB.  While precise quantification is challenging at this stage, the successful development of a more accurate and efficient microbial genome identification pipeline holds significant intangible value. This includes:

* **Accelerated Research:** The improved pipeline will expedite future research on the citrus microbiome, facilitating faster identification of beneficial microbes and potential biocontrol agents.
* **Enhanced Understanding:**  More complete microbial genomes will provide a deeper understanding of the functional roles of microbes within the citrus holobiont.
* **Potential for HLB Management:** This research may contribute to the development of novel strategies for managing HLB, offering substantial long-term economic benefits to the citrus industry.

**GCP Cost Estimate:**

The information provided is insufficient for a precise GCP cost estimate.  While the request specifies the desired compute resources (128 cores per node, 9-16 nodes), critical information regarding memory requirements, attached disks, and data storage needs is missing.  Further, the existing resource usage is unclear. To provide a reliable cost estimate, the following details are required:

* **Memory per node:**  The required RAM per node is crucial for determining instance type and cost.
* **Disk type and size:** Specifying the required storage (HDD/SSD) and total volume will inform storage costs.
* **Current resource usage:**  Understanding the current allocation will allow for accurate estimation of the incremental cost of the extension.
* **Software licensing:**  Any required commercial software licenses within the GCP environment should be identified.


**Recommendation:**

The proposed research addresses a critical problem with significant potential impact.  However, the lack of detailed resource requirements prevents a definitive cost assessment.  Therefore, we recommend **conditional approval** of the proposal pending submission of the missing information outlined above. Upon receipt of the necessary details, a revised cost estimate and final recommendation will be provided.  We encourage the Borneman Lab to consult with GCP experts to optimize their resource allocation and minimize costs.
