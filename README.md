## Cutting-Edge Research Computing ##

**Modern research requires advanced computing and data management resources** 
Welcome to the University of California, Riverside Research Computing Service, where we provide cutting-edge technology and resources to support the research endeavors of all UCR researchers. Our partnership with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) allows us to offer a range of services, including secure research workstations, auto-scaling HPC clusters, infinity scaling databases, AI and machine learning services, and web servers and secure research storage. These resources are designed to increase productivity, attract and retain top talent, improve collaboration, increase grant funding, improve research outcomes, and save costs, all while improving data management.

We understand the importance of collaboration in research and are proud to partner with some of UCR's most important support units, including BCOE, the Library, CHASS, ITS, and others, to ensure that we provide the best possible resources and support to our research community. Our research computing team is dedicated to serving the needs of UCR researchers and is always available to answer any questions and provide support.

With access to advanced computational resources and storage, UCR researchers can conduct more complex and data-intensive research projects, analyze large data sets, perform complex simulations and modeling, and develop new technologies faster and more efficiently. Our goal is to drive increased research output and grant funding, campus income, campus prestige, and the hiring of amazing new faculty for UCR. This is not just a free service, it's a subsidized investment in the future of research at our R1 research university.

We invite you to explore our services and discover how the University of California, Riverside Research Computing Service can support your research goals. Let's work together to push the boundaries of what's possible.
