### Flexable Cost Models

The University of California, Riverside (UCR) provides a comprehensive and flexible approach to funding and cost models for research computing, designed to support the diverse needs of the research community. Here's an overview of the available cost models:

- **System-Wide Discounted Rates**: UCR has established agreements with major cloud service providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) to offer cloud computing resources at reduced rates, benefiting the entire UCR community.

- **UCR Subsidized Access**: Certain resources and services, including cloud computing resources and high-performance computing platforms, are provided at no cost to end users, subsidized by UCR to support academic and research projects.

- **Condo Model**: This collaborative model allows faculty and departments to contribute financially to HPC resources in exchange for priority access and a portion of the computing capacity, promoting efficient resource use and community investment in research infrastructure.

- **No-Cost Access**: Specific initiatives, such as the Ursa Major project in partnership with GCP, provide cutting-edge computing tools and services at no cost, aiming to revolutionize research computing at UCR.

- **Direct Cost Options**: For projects requiring specialized or additional resources, direct cost options are available, offering project-specific funding solutions to meet unique research needs.

## Training, Workshops and Resources

Committed to empowering its research community by providing comprehensive training and educational resources in research computing. Our goal is to enhance the skills and knowledge of researchers, enabling them to effectively utilize advanced computing tools and technologies in their work. Below is a summary of the training opportunities available to UCR researchers, faculty, and students.
