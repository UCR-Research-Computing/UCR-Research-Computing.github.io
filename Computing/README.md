# UCR Research Computing Resources
Depending on the nature of the research you are conducting and the computing resources required, different options below are available to satisfy most needs. Most research computing computation and associated workflows can be served by UCR's *Ursa Major* Research Computing Platform or the High-Performance Computing Center with an outstanding GPU-enabled computing cluster and GPFS high-speed parallel storage. There are many other computing operations and workflows that may be better suited on one of the other resources.
