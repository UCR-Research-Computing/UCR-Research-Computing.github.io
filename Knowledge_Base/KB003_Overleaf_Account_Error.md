# KB 003: "Account Already Registered" Error
**Category:** Overleaf (LaTeX)
**Audience:** BearHelp Tier 1 Support

**Symptom:** User tries to link UCR SSO to Overleaf but sees: *"The email/institution account you tried to add is already registered."*
**Cause:** User has two accounts: one `netid@ucr.edu` and one departmental alias (e.g., `@ece.ucr.edu`).
**Resolution:**
1.  **Do not** try to fix locally.
2.  **Instruct User:** "Please email **support@overleaf.com** directly. State that you have two accounts (departmental and main UCR) and need them merged."
