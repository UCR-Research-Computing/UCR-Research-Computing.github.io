## 1. What is NAIRR?
The **National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR)** Pilot is a federal initiative connecting U.S. researchers to computational, data, and software resources for AI research *at no cost*.

**Best For:**
*   **Exotic Hardware:** Access to Cerebras, SambaNova, Graphcore, and Groq accelerators.
*   **Massive Scale:** Training jobs requiring hundreds of H100/A100 GPUs.
*   **Model Access:** API credits for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face.

## 2. Allocation Types

### A. Startup Projects (The "On-Ramp")
*   **Purpose:** Benchmarking, code testing, and preparing for full proposals.
*   **Duration:** Up to 3 months.
*   **Review:** Fast-tracked (~2 weeks).
*   **Strategy:** Use this to prove your code scales before asking for a massive allocation.

### B. Research Resources
*   **Purpose:** Full-scale scientific campaigns.
*   **Duration:** 12 months (typically).
*   **Review:** Standard NSF-style peer review (Monthly/Quarterly cycles).
