# **1. Eligibility & Access**  

## **Who Can Use Ursa Major?**  
Ursa Major is available to **all UCR-affiliated researchers**, including:  
- **Faculty members**
- **Postdoctoral researchers**
- **Graduate students** (if affiliated with a research project)  
- **Staff members** conducting research-related activities  

### **How to Get Started**  
To use Ursa Major, researchers must:  
1. Have an **active UCR NetID**.  
2. Complete the required **Ursa Major training and acknowledgment process**.  
3. Submit an allocation request according to their research needs (details below).  

Researchers will be assigned **either an Explore Tier or Advanced Tier allocation** based on their proposal and needs.

---

# **2. Resource Allocation Model**  

Ursa Major operates on a **tiered resource allocation system** to balance equitable access while supporting diverse research requirements.  

## **2.1 Allocation Tiers**  

### **Explore Tier (Default Allocation)**  
The **Explore Tier** is designed for **introductory research, small-scale projects, and early experimentation** with cloud resources.  

#### **Key Details:**
- **$1,500 credit allocation** (~3 months of usage at ~$15/day)
- Covers **Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, AI/ML tools (Vertex AI), and other core GCP services**  
- **No application review required** (automatic approval)
- **Usage alerts at 50%, 75%, 95%, and 100% of the budget**

Researchers can monitor their usage through the **Ursa Major dashboard**.  

---

### **Advanced Tier (For Larger Projects)**
The **Advanced Tier** is intended for researchers with **high-performance computing (HPC), GPU-intensive workloads, and large-scale cloud research projects**.

#### **Key Details:**
- **Requires application & faculty panel review** (see below for structure)
- Allocations are granted on **a quarterly cycle** with **defined application deadlines**
- Advanced allocations are **not processed immediately** but **reviewed as a group** to ensure fair distribution
- Applicants must submit **a proposal detailing their resource needs, research impact, and estimated costs**  

---

## **2.2 Advanced Tier Application Process & Review Structure**  

### **ðŸ”¹ How & When to Apply for an Advanced Allocation**
Advanced allocations follow a **structured quarterly application and review process**, ensuring fairness and predictability.  

#### **Initial Allocation Period (March â€“ June 2025)**
- The **first Advanced Tier application window** opens **March 1, 2025**.  
- Applications must be submitted **by March 14, 2025** for consideration.  
- Reviews will take place between **March 15 â€“ March 25, 2025**.  
- Allocations will be **approved and available starting April 1, 2025**.  

#### **Quarterly Allocation Cycles**
After the **initial allocation period**, Advanced Tier applications will follow a **standard quarterly review**:  

| Application Deadline | Review Period | Allocations Start |  
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------|  
| **March 14** | March 15 â€“ March 25 | **April 1 â€“ June 30** |  
| **June 14** | June 15 â€“ June 25 | **July 1 â€“ September 30** |  
| **September 14** | September 15 â€“ September 25 | **October 1 â€“ December 31** |  

**Applicants will receive notification of acceptance or denial within 5 business days after the review period ends.**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Faculty Panel Review & Allocation Limits**  

Advanced allocations will be **reviewed by a faculty panel**, but with a **tiered review structure** to streamline approvals:  

#### **Review Structure:**  
1. **Small to Medium Requests (â‰¤$5,000/quarter):**  
   - Reviewed by **Ursa Major administrative staff** (does not require faculty panel approval).  
   - Quick turnaround **within 7 days** of submission.  

2. **Large Requests (>$5,000/quarter or high-impact projects):**  
   - Reviewed by a **faculty panel** on a quarterly cycle.  
   - Faculty must evaluate **scientific merit, impact, and feasibility**.  
   - **Resource availability is a key factor** in decision-making.  

#### **Total Resource Pool & Approval Limits**  
- **Total budget available per quarter:** **$X,000/day for ALL Advanced allocations combined.**  
- Faculty reviewers **must allocate within this budget**â€”requests exceeding the available funding will be deferred or revised.  

---

# **3. What Happens if You Run Out of Resources?**  

If a research project **reaches the limit of its allocation**, the following applies:

1. **Explore Tier Users:**  
   - Receive **a 7-14 day grace period** for data retrieval.  
   - Can apply for an **Advanced allocation** before reaching 95% usage.  

2. **Advanced Tier Users:**  
   - Must **submit a renewal request** before the next review cycle if continued access is required.  
   - If **budget is depleted before the next allocation cycle**, researchers can request **temporary reduced-access extensions** (reviewed case-by-case).

# **4. Support & Assistance**  

### **Who to Contact for Help**  
For technical or allocation issues, contact **Ursa Major Research Support**:  
ðŸ“© **Email:** [research-computing@ucr.edu](mailto:research-computing@ucr.edu)  

### **Response Time Expectations**
| Issue Type | Expected Response Time |
|------------|------------------------|
| Routine Questions | 1-2 business days |
| Technical Troubleshooting | 2-4 business days |
| Advanced Allocation Review | **Quarterly review cycle** |
| Urgent Issues (e.g., shutdown prevention) | **Same-day escalation** |

# **5. Security, Data Privacy, & Future Planning**  

### **Data Ownership & Privacy**  
- **All research data remains the property of the researcher/UCR.**  
- **No unauthorized access or monitoring**â€”Google & UCR **do not claim ownership or review your data**.  
- **Government/legal requests** for data require researcher notification **unless legally restricted**.  

### **Planning Beyond the Current Contract**  
The current Ursa Major contract expires in **11 months**. The university is actively planning for the **next phase of cloud resource availability**. Updates will be provided as decisions are made regarding **renewals, funding, and resource expansions**.
