# Ursa Major Guidelines

To ensure the responsible and ethical use of Ursa Major services, the following guidelines have been established. These guidelines outline the terms of access, usage, support, privacy, ownership, security, and stewardship for Ursa Major. We strongly advise all users to read and understand these guidelines before using Ursa Major services.


# Access Guidelines


## Eligibility

The University of California, Riversideâ€™s Ursa Major service is available to all researchers affiliated with the university. This includes faculty, staff, postdoctoral researchers, and students affiliated with research activities . The researcher must have a campus NetID and must have completed the necessary training and DocuSign  to use the Ursa Major services.


## Resource Allocation

To promote fair and equitable access to Ursa Major services for all researchers, we have established a tiered resource allocation approach. This approach ensures that available resources are distributed fairly among researchers, taking into account the specific needs and requirements of each project.

Our commitment to fostering research excellence and innovation at UCR led us to develop this strategic framework for allocating Ursa Major services. This framework ensures equitable access to advanced cloud resources for all researchers, aligning with our objectives of enhancing research capabilities and securing more grant funding. By prioritizing projects with significant potential for academic and societal impact, and showcasing cloud technology's transformative applications, we aim to optimize resource distribution across the research community.

This approach ensures that resources are allocated fairly and used to drive impactful research projects, advancing UCR's research agenda and attracting significant grant funding. This strengthens our research infrastructure, attracts top talent, and enhances UCR's prestige and competitiveness.

### Ursa Major Resource Allocation Framework

UCR's strategic approach to Ursa Major resource allocation ensures equitable access for researchers, prioritizing projects with significant potential for impact. The framework supports both high-value and exploratory projects through a tiered system, optimizing cloud resource distribution and enhancing research capabilities.

#### Allocation Tiers

* **Explore Tier:** This tier provides a baseline level of resources suitable for researchers who are new to GCP or conducting small-scale experiments and projects. This tier allows for experimentation with various cloud technologies, small-scale storage needs, and testing code before deploying on a larger scale within the Advanced Tier.
* **Advanced Tier:** This tier is designed for researchers with larger-scale projects and higher resource demands, including moderate to high use of GPUs and most high-performance computing (HPC) needs involving large CPU and memory usage. Access to this tier will be granted based on a proposal review process conducted by a faculty panel.
* **Researcher-Focused Subscription Agreement Tier:** This tier, funded by the researcher, offers a dedicated GCP environment managed by ITS in close collaboration with Google. The use cases for this tier are limited only by the funding available on the subscription agreement. This includes use of GPUs, HPC workloads, AI model training, and more.
