# Ursa Major Guidelines

## **Overview**

Ursa Major is the **University of California, Riversideâ€™s (UCR) cloud computing resource** for research, providing scalable access to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. These guidelines are designed to ensure the **equitable, responsible, and efficient** use of Ursa Major resources while supporting high-impact research at UCR.

This document outlines the following:

- **Eligibility and Access**
- **Resource Allocation Policies (Explore & Advanced Tiers)**
- **Application Processes and Review Cycles**
- **Usage Guidelines and Compliance**
- **Support, Privacy, and Security Measures**
- **Future Planning for Ursa Major Resources**

# **1. Eligibility & Access**

## **Who Can Use Ursa Major?**

Ursa Major is available to **all UCR-affiliated researchers**, including:

- **Faculty members**
- **Postdoctoral researchers**
- **Graduate students** (if affiliated with a research project)
- **Staff members** conducting research-related activities

### **How to Get Started**

To use Ursa Major, researchers must:

1. Have an **active UCR NetID**.
2. Complete the required **Ursa Major training and acknowledgment process**.
3. Submit an allocation request according to their research needs (details below).

Researchers will be assigned **either an Explore Tier or Advanced Tier allocation** based on their proposal and needs.

---

# **2. Resource Allocation Model**

Ursa Major operates on a **tiered resource allocation system** to balance equitable access while supporting diverse research requirements.

## **2.1 Allocation Tiers**

### **Explore Tier (Default Allocation)**

The **Explore Tier** is designed for **introductory research, small-scale projects, and early experimentation** with cloud resources.

#### **Key Details:**

- **$1,500 credit allocation** (~3 months of usage at ~$15/day)
- Covers **Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, AI/ML tools (Vertex AI), and other core GCP services**
- **No application review required** (automatic approval)
- **Usage alerts at 50%, 75%, 95%, and 100% of the budget**

Researchers can monitor their usage through the **[Ursa Major dashboard](https://ucr-research-computing.github.io/pages/ursa_major.html#monitoring-allocations)**.

---

### **Advanced Tier (For Larger Projects)**

The **Advanced Tier** is intended for researchers with **high-performance computing (HPC), GPU-intensive workloads, and large-scale cloud research projects**.

#### **Key Details:**

- **Requires application & Research Advisory Board (RAB) subgroup review**
- Allocations are granted on **a quarterly cycle** with **defined application deadlines**
- Advanced allocations are **not processed immediately** but **reviewed as a group** to ensure fair distribution
- Applicants must submit **a proposal detailing their resource needs, research impact, and estimated costs**

---

## **2.2 Advanced Tier Application Process & Review Structure**

### **ðŸ”¹ How & When to Apply for an Advanced Allocation**

Advanced allocations follow a **structured quarterly application and review process**, ensuring fairness and predictability.

#### **Initial Allocation Period (March â€“ June 2025)**

- The **first Advanced Tier application window** opens **March 1, 2025**.
- Applications must be submitted **by March 14, 2025** for consideration.
- Reviews will take place between **March 15 â€“ March 25, 2025**.
- Allocations will be **approved and available starting April 1, 2025**.

#### **Quarterly Allocation Cycles**

After the **initial allocation period**, Advanced Tier applications will follow a **standard quarterly review**:

| Application Deadline | Review Period               | Allocations Start           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **March 14**         | March 15 â€“ March 25         | **April 1 â€“ June 30**       |
| **June 14**          | June 15 â€“ June 25           | **July 1 â€“ September 30**   |
| **September 14**     | September 15 â€“ September 25 | **October 1 â€“ December 31** |

**Applicants will receive notification of acceptance or denial within 5 business days after the review period ends.**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Research Advisory Board Subgroup Review & Allocation Limits**

All Advanced allocation applications will be reviewed by a **subgroup of the Research Advisory Board (RAB)** that evaluates requests based on research merit, impact, feasibility, and available resources.

#### **Review Criteria:**
- **Scientific and academic merit** of the research project
- **Impact and feasibility** of the proposed resource use
- **Remaining GCP resource availability** for that allocation cycle

The **total available budget per quarter** is a key factor in approval decisions. If resource demands exceed the available funding, projects may receive **partial allocations** or be deferred to the next cycle. The RAB review panel will ensure that allocations are distributed equitably while maximizing research impact.

---

# **3. What Happens if You Run Out of Resources?**

If a research project **reaches the limit of its allocation**, the following applies:

1. **Explore Tier Users:**
   - Receive **a 7-14 day grace period** for data retrieval.
   - Can apply for an **Advanced allocation** before reaching 95% usage.

2. **Advanced Tier Users:**
   - Must **submit a renewal request** before the next review cycle if continued access is required.
   - If **budget is depleted before the next allocation cycle**, researchers can request **temporary reduced-access extensions** (reviewed case-by-case).

# **5. Security, Data Privacy, & Future Planning**

### **Data Ownership & Privacy**

- **All research data remains the property of the researcher/UCR.**
- **No unauthorized access or monitoring**â€”Google & UCR **do not claim ownership or review your data**.
- **Government/legal requests** for data require researcher notification **unless legally restricted**.

### **Planning Beyond the Current Contract**

The current Ursa Major contract expires in **11 months**. The university is actively planning for the **next phase of cloud resource availability**. Updates will be provided as decisions are made regarding **renewals, funding, and resource expansions**.
