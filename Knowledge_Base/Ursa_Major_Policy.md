# Ursa Major Policy

To ensure the responsible and ethical use of Ursa Major services, the following policies have been established. These policies outline the terms of access, usage, support, privacy, ownership, security, and stewardship for Ursa Major. We strongly advise all users to read and understand these policies before using Ursa Major services.


# Access Policy


## Eligibility

The University of California, Riversideâ€™s Ursa Major service is available to all researchers affiliated with the university. This includes faculty, staff, postdoctoral researchers, and students affiliated with research activities . The researcher must have a campus NetID and must have completed the necessary training and DocuSign  to use the Ursa Major services.


## Resource Allocation

To promote fair and equitable access to Ursa Major services for all researchers, the following resource allocation approach has been established. This approach outlines the process of resource allocation, ensuring that the available resources are distributed fairly among the researchers while taking into account the specific needs and requirements of each project.

In our commitment to fostering an environment of research excellence and innovation at UCR, we've developed a strategic framework for the allocation of Ursa Major services. This framework is designed to ensure all researchers have equitable access to advanced cloud resources, aligning with our broader objectives of enhancing research capabilities and securing more grant funding. By prioritizing projects that demonstrate significant potential for academic and societal impact, and showcasing the transformative applications of cloud technology, we aim to optimize the distribution of resources across the research community.

This approach ensures that resources are not only allocated fairly but also used to drive forward the most impactful research projects. By doing so, we aim to not only advance UCR's research agenda but also attract significant grant funding. This, in turn, bolsters our campus's research infrastructure, attracts top-tier talent, and ultimately, enhances the prestige and competitiveness of UCR within the academic community.

- Tiered resource allocation:
    * Tiered allocation system based on factors such as project maturity, cloud experience, project timing, or project funding. Allocating more resources to time bound and/or high value resource needs. While still providing some access to resources for long running, exploratory or early-stage projects.
    * Allow researchers to request an allocation for GCP resources for specific periods of time, ensuring that resources are available when needed and reducing the risk of resource contention among researchers.
- Prioritize projects based on research impact
    * Allocate resources to projects with high potential impact, innovative research projects, or those with strong potential for future funding.
Set maximum running resource quotas per allocation:
    * This can vary among projects, and would be based on requested resources, such as compute, storage, etc.
- Monitor resource usage and adjust allocations:
    * Regularly monitor the usage of GCP resources by RC Team and researchers themselves to identify inefficiencies, unused allocations, or bottlenecks. Adjust the allocations based on actual usage patterns to optimize the utilization of the budget.
    * This may involve reconfiguring resources in use to better fit the performance needs of the project, which may require short maintenance windows where running jobs, simulations, etc may need to be stopped to make the requisite changes.
- Continuously evaluate and optimize allocations:
    * Regularly review the effectiveness of the allocation strategy and make adjustments as necessary to ensure optimal use of the GCP Subscription.

By implementing these ideas, the university can allocate the Ursa Major campus budget fairly and effectively across as many researchers as possible, maximizing the return on investment and promoting efficient use of resources.

### Ursa Major Resource Allocation Framework

UCR's strategic approach to Ursa Major resource allocation ensures equitable access for researchers, prioritizing projects with significant potential for impact. The framework supports both high-value and exploratory projects through a tiered system, optimizing cloud resource distribution and enhancing research capabilities.

- **Explore Tier:** Allocated 20% of our total allocation pool. Designed for novel, long-term uses without a time-bound element, encouraging exploratory and innovative research.
- **Project Tier:** Receives 40% to 60% of our allocation pool. This tier is both value and time-bound, intended for substantial research projects that demonstrate potential value through grants, papers, or publications. Allocation scheduling is strategic to accommodate and optimize large project resources.
- **Campus Tier:** Initially allocated 20% of the pool, with potential to expand to 40%. Reserved for the Campus ITS Infrastucture, this tier allows flexible usage within its limit, supporting internal technological advancements and infrastructure needs.

### Obtaining a Ursa Major Resource Allocation:

1. Researchers submit an allocation request [Here](https://forms.gle/usMEn3F9db7rHVhR9) or through the Ursa Major section of the Research Computing Web Portal or ITS Service Now, providing essential details about their research project and the specific services required.  This may include software needs, hardware requirements, storage capacity needs, etc, and length of time needed.
2. The Research Computing Team will schedule an intake meeting with the lab to understand their research needs and discuss how an Ursa Major allocation can be beneficial.
3. The Research Computing Team will review the request, considering the project's needs, the alignment of resources and services requested, and the availability of Ursa Major resources to accommodate the proposed allocation.
4. If the request is approved, the researcher will receive a confirmation email with access instructions and follow-up meetings will be scheduled to facilitate research collaboration and support.

### **Monitoring Allocations:**

To ensure the efficient use of resources and to support our researchers in the best possible manner, UCR's Research Computing team has implemented a comprehensive monitoring and optimization strategy for Ursa Major resource allocations. This approach enables us to track resource usage in real-time, identify bottlenecks, and optimize allocations to support a wide range of research activities effectively.
