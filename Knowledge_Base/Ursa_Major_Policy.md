# Ursa Major Guidelines

To ensure the responsible and ethical use of Ursa Major services, the following guidelines have been established. These guidelines outline the terms of access, usage, support, privacy, ownership, security, and stewardship for Ursa Major. We strongly advise all users to read and understand these guidelines before using Ursa Major services.

# Access Guidelines

## Eligibility

The University of California, Riverside’s Ursa Major service is available to all researchers affiliated with the university. This includes faculty, staff, postdoctoral researchers, and students affiliated with research activities. The researcher must have a campus NetID and must have completed the necessary training and DocuSign to use the Ursa Major services.

## Resource Allocation

Ursa Major services operate under a **tiered resource allocation model** to ensure fair and sustainable access for all researchers. This approach balances introductory research needs with larger-scale computational demands.

### **Ursa Major Resource Allocation Tiers**

- **Explore Tier:** Provides a baseline level of resources suitable for introductory research, experimentation, and small-scale projects. Researchers at this tier receive a **$1,500 credit**, which supports approximately three months of usage at an estimated spend rate of **$15/day**. This includes Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and AI/ML tools such as Vertex AI (excluding Marketplace). Budget tracking alerts will be sent at **50%, 75%, 95%, and 100%** usage levels.
  
- **Advanced Tier:** Designed for projects with larger-scale computing demands, including moderate-to-high GPU usage and HPC needs. Access requires an application and review by the Research Advisory Board. Factors such as resource availability, timing, and research value (publications, grants, output) will be considered.

- **Researcher-Focused Subscription Agreement Tier:** A dedicated GCP environment funded by the researcher, managed by ITS in collaboration with Google. This tier allows unrestricted use of GPUs, HPC workloads, AI model training, and more, subject only to available funding.

### **Requesting an Ursa Major Allocation**

Submit your allocation request using the links below:

- **[Explore Allocation Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclKhikqwHOWhDDJV5tNAGGFdoqpkx8sdWnudLBhXWlj5NofA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**
- **[Advanced Allocation Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd40G615UwddDPpnUTRLmdJcysXhZ_RUXBYEGICQCYWQmK8_A/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

The Research Advisory Board will review applications and approve them based on available resources.

### **Policy on Exceeding Allocations**

- If a project's resource usage exceeds the **Explore Tier** limit, the billing account will be **temporarily placed on hold**. Systems will be shut down, and storage access will be blocked.
- **No data will be deleted or destroyed.** Researchers will be contacted and given time to retrieve data before applying for a new allocation.
- Once all projects transition to the **Explore Tier**, the Advanced Tier request process will open (expected early March).

### **Alternative Computing Resources**

While waiting for Advanced Tier allocations, researchers can explore the following alternative computing resources:

- **NSF ACCESS Program** (streamlined application available)
- **Open Science Grid**
- **NSF Nautilus Cluster**
- **Campus High Performance Computing Cluster**
- **Other external resources recommended by the Research Computing Team**
