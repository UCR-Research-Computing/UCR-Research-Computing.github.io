# KB009: Using NSF ACCESS for High-Performance Computing

**Scope:** Large-Scale HPC (CPU/GPU)
**Audience:** Researchers needing capacity beyond UCR's local HPCC
**Last Updated:** Feb 9, 2026

## 1. What is ACCESS?
**ACCESS** (Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support) is the NSF's primary program for providing computing resources to US researchers. It replaces the former XSEDE program.

**Best For:**
*   **Scale:** Jobs requiring thousands of cores or multi-node GPU training.
*   **Capacity:** When UCR's local HPCC queue is full or too small for your workload.
*   **Specialized Architectures:** FPGAs, large-memory nodes (TB+ RAM).

## 2. Allocation Tiers (The "Credit" System)
ACCESS uses "Service Units" (credits) which you exchange for compute time on supercomputers like **Stampede3**, **Jetstream2**, and **Anvil**.

*   **Explore:** Small allocation for testing/benchmarking. (Auto-approved).
*   **Discover:** Moderate allocation for standard grants. (Light review).
*   **Accelerate:** Large allocation for major campaigns. (Panel review).
*   **Maximize:** Massive allocation for grand challenges. (Strict panel review).

## 3. How to Apply
1.  **Create Account:** Go to [access-ci.org](https://access-ci.org) and sign in with your UCR credentials (via CILogon).
2.  **Request "Explore":** Start here. Write a simple abstract (1 paragraph) to get immediate credits.
3.  **Transfer Credits:** "Exchange" your credits for time on a specific resource (e.g., SDSC Expanse).

**Campus Champion:**
Chuck Forsyth is UCR's **ACCESS Campus Champion**. He can provide immediate "Startup" allocations and guidance on writing successful proposals.
