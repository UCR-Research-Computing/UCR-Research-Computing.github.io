## Connecting to a GCP VM using the Web Console:

* Open the Google Cloud Platform Console and select your project.
* In the navigation menu, click on the "Compute Engine" option.
* In the "Compute Engine" section, click on the "VM instances" option.
* Find the instance that you want to connect to and click on the instance name to view its details.
* In the "Connect" section, click on the "SSH" button. This will open the "Connect to instance" dialog box.
* In the "Connect to instance" dialog box, choose the "Web-based SSH" option and then click the "Connect" button.
* This will launch a new tab in your web browser and connect you to the instance.

### Connecting to a GCP VM using the gcloud command line:

* Open the command line terminal.
* Make sure you have the gcloud CLI installed and configured for your Google Cloud Platform project.
* Run the following command to connect to your instance:
```bash
gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone [ZONE_NAME]
```
*  Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` with the name of your instance and `[ZONE_NAME]` with the zone the instance is in.
* You will be prompted to authenticate to your Google account if you haven't already.
* Once authentication is complete, you will be connected to the instance.

Note: If you have a firewall rule in place, you may need to configure it to allow access to your instance before you can connect.
