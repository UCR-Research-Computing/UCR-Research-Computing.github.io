Some amaizing ways Ursa Major Research Workstations are amazing:

* **Customizable Configurations:** Ursa Major's VMs offer flexibility in CPU core count, CPU type, and RAM size, enabling researchers to tailor their systems to their unique research requirements.
* **Cost-Effective Baseline:** Basic Ursa Major VMs (`e2-standard-2`) are provided at no cost under the Tier 1 subsidy, allowing researchers to save on the cost of buying and maintaining low-end hardware.
* **OS Flexibility:** Researchers have a range of operating system options available on Ursa Major's VMs, allowing them to choose the one that best fits their needs.
* **Persistence for Containers:** Ursa Major's VMs offer container persistence, allowing researchers to store data, results, and configurations even if the VM is shut down.
* **GPU Options (Tier 2 Recharge):** Ursa Major offers various GPU options (A100, L4, T4) for demanding graphical or computational workloads. **Note:** Cloud GPUs are not covered by the university subsidy and require a Tier 2 Direct Recharge agreement. For no-cost GPU access, please utilize the [UCR HPCC](../pages/HPCC.md).
* **Scalability:** Ursa Major's VMs offer easy scalability, so researchers can add more CPU power, memory, or GPUs (via Tier 2) as their needs change.
* **Reliability:** Ursa Major's VMs are dependable and backed by strong support, giving researchers the peace of mind that their systems will be operational when needed.
