### Strategic Storage Tiers

**1. Tier 1 (Subsidized Pool): Archive & Small Datasets**
Ursa Major provides subsidized access to **Coldline Storage**, designed specifically for long-term grant compliance archiving, reproducibility snapshots, and backups. This allows researchers to secure their data long-term without incurring ongoing hardware costs. Small-scale standard storage for active workflows is also supported within quota limits.

**2. Tier 2 (Commercial Recharge): High-Performance & Massive Scale**
For workloads requiring massive-scale hot storage (petabytes of active data), high-IOPS persistent disks, or specialized file systems (like Google Filestore), researchers must utilize the **Tier 2 Direct Recharge** model. These resources are billed directly to a grant Chart of Accounts (COA) at negotiated enterprise rates. For subsidized high-performance active storage, researchers are encouraged to utilize the [local HPCC and CephRDS systems](../pages/storage-overview.md).

### Big Data Analytics
When integrated with Tier 2 resources like BigQuery, Ursa Major Cloud Storage offers researchers a powerful platform for big data analytics, enabling the processing of massive datasets with cloud-native speed.

### Secure Collaboration
Ursa Major Cloud Storage offers a secure platform for researchers to collaborate and share their work. With its security and compliance features, researchers can feel confident that their data is safe and secure, even when working with external institutions.

### Security and Compliance
Ursa Major Cloud Storage is designed with security and compliance in mind. With robust IAM and encryption features, researchers can store sensitive data (up to P4_CRITICAL in designated Secure Enclaves) and meet stringent federal regulations like NIST 800-171 and HIPAA.

### Google Drive Integration
In addition to Ursa Major Cloud Storage Buckets, researchers can also take advantage of Google Drive for document management and team sharing. While Google Drive is limited to 500GB per account, it serves as an excellent companion to Ursa Major for day-to-day administrative and collaborative files.
