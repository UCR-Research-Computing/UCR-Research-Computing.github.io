# What is High-Performance Computing (HPC)?

High-Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers significantly greater computational power than traditional computers and servers. HPC, or supercomputing, is like standard workstation computing, only more powerful. It is a way of processing huge volumes of data at very high speeds using multiple computers and storage devices as a cohesive fabric. HPC makes it possible to explore and find answers to some of the world’s biggest problems in science, engineering, and research.

Today, HPC is used to solve complex, performance-intensive problems—and organizations are increasingly moving HPC workloads to the cloud. For UCR's HPC offerings, including on-premise and cloud-based solutions like Ursa Major, please see the [Computing Resources Overview](/pages/computing-resources-overview.md).
