## Compute Resource Policies

- **HPCC Policy**: Access to HPC resources is determined by project needs, focusing on research impact and computational demand. Cloud computing services are partnered with major providers to offer discounted rates and custom solutions.
- **UCR-Ursa Major Policy**: Grants no-cost access to Google Cloud Platform for research with significant potential. Selection is through an internal review, focusing on project innovation. [Ursa Major Policy details](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Policy.md).
- **NSF Resources**: Describe how UCR researchers can access National Science Foundation (NSF) computing resources, including XSEDE.
- **Cloud Computing Policy**: Outline the guidelines for using cloud services, including security, data management, and cost management policies.

## Data Management Policies

- [**Data Solutions and Plans**](https://ucr-research-computing.github.io/pages/storage-overview.html#storage-overview): At the University of California, Riverside (UCR), we align our research computing storage infrastructure with the highest standards of the American Association of Universities (AAU). Our commitment is to offer advanced storage solutions that meet the diverse needs of our research community, foster innovation, and enhance collaboration. Our strategy includes enhancing research productivity, ensuring data integrity and security, and promoting open science and collaboration. For a detailed overview, including a comparison of available storage solutions, view the [Storage Solutions Comparison Sheet](https://ucr-research-computing.github.io/pages/storage-overview.html#storage-overview).
- **[UC Research Data Policy](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2500700/ResearchData)**: Reflects the long-standing principle of ownership of research data by the Regents of the University of California, as articulated in Section 020 of the Academic Personnel Manual (APM-020). This policy clarifies the ownership and responsibility for research data generated during University research, promotes active data management and sharing practices, and guides procedures when a University Researcher leaves the University.

## Support Policies

- [**Research Computing System Administration Service (RCSAS)**](https://ucr-research-computing.github.io/pages/research_infrastructure_support.html): Offers system design consultation, performance optimization, and security compliance checks. Tiered support ensures basic assistance for all projects and advanced support for those with specialized needs.
- [**Research Facilitation and Training**](https://ucr-research-computing.github.io/pages/research_facilitation.html): Provides workshops and training sessions on a variety of topics, from basic computing to advanced machine learning. Personalized advice on computing strategies, software selection, and workflow optimization is available by appointment.
- [**Grant Collaboration**](https://ucr-research-computing.github.io/pages/grant_colab.html): Assists researchers in incorporating computing resources into grant proposals, offering support in drafting computational methodologies, estimating resource needs, and ensuring proposals are competitive.
- [**Lab Support**](https://ucr-research-computing.github.io/pages/lab-support.html): Tailored to meet the specific computational needs of research labs, including software installations, configuration of computing clusters, and data storage solutions. This service also offers troubleshooting and periodic reviews to align with evolving research demands.

## Security Policies

- **Security Policies and Regulations**: UCR's research computing environment adheres to several key security standards to protect sensitive data:
    - **[CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Model/)**: A framework designed to protect the defense industrial base from cybersecurity threats. CMMC outlines a comprehensive range of cybersecurity standards and best practices to ensure the security and resilience of defense-related information and technologies.
    - **[UC IS-3](http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000543/BFB-IS-3)**: The University of California's policy on information security, which sets forth the standards for protecting institutional and personal information across all UC campuses. This policy mandates a proactive approach to information security management, risk assessment, and incident response.
    - **[NIST 800-171](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/what-nist-sp-800-171-and-who-needs-follow-it-0)**: Provides guidelines for protecting controlled unclassified information (CUI) in non-federal systems and organizations. NIST 800-171 is critical for research projects that handle sensitive information, ensuring that data security practices align with federal standards for information confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    - **[NSPM-33](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-united-states-government-supported-research-development-national-security-policy/)**: A National Security Presidential Memorandum focused on improving the security of systems related to National Security, Defense, and the Intelligence Community. NSPM-33 emphasizes the importance of securing research and development activities against espionage, theft, and exploitation.


## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

- **SLA Overview**: Defines expectations for major services, including uptime guarantees for HPC resources, response times for cloud services, resolution times for RCSAS support requests, and post-session support for training services.

## Campus Policies

- **[Campus Policies](https://compliance.ucr.edu/policies)**: Policies and procedures are foundational at UCR.  Policies show us what type of place UCR isâ€“how we are to treat one another, and how we can expect to be treated.  Policies and procedures show us how we are expected to do certain aspects of our jobs, and how we conduct ourselves when representing the university.
