# Open Science Grid (OSG) Overview

The **Open Science Grid (OSG)** is a nationwide, distributed high-throughput computing (dHTC) platform that empowers researchers with scalable compute and data resources. By pooling resources from multiple institutions, OSG accelerates scientific discovery while reducing the overhead of maintaining local clusters.

---

## Why OSG Matters for Your Research

- **Accelerate Discovery:** Run thousands of concurrent jobs and process massive datasets efficiently.
- **Scale On Demand:** Leverage multi-petabyte compute power without the need for in-house infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effective:** Minimize costs by sharing resources and reducing administrative burdens.
- **Foster Collaboration:** Connect with a national community of experts and resource providers.

## The OSG Ecosystem

### Collaborative Consortium

- **Resource Providers:** Universities, national labs, and research institutions share spare cycles and storage.
- **Research Communities:** Diverse disciplines—from particle physics to genomics—benefit from high-throughput computing.
- **Governance & Support:** 
  - The **OSG Council** sets strategic priorities.
  - The **Executive Team** manages daily operations.
  - Funding comes from NSF initiatives (e.g., NSF PATh #2030508) and other partners.

### Distributed High Throughput Computing (dHTC)

OSG’s dHTC model allows you to:
- **Run Parallel Tasks:** Distribute independent jobs across thousands of nodes.
- **Optimize Throughput:** Automatically match jobs to available resources.
- **Support Varied Workloads:** Easily switch between data analysis, simulations, and more.

## Key Technologies and Services

- **Virtual Clusters:** Build your own “virtual cluster” by tapping into shared computing resources.
- **Global Research Accounting (GRACC):** Monitor your job performance and resource usage with detailed metrics.
- **Open Science Pool (OSPool):** Access NSF-supported compute capacity through institutional access points or the OSG Portal.
- **Standardized Job Tools:** Use familiar interfaces and scripts to submit, monitor, and manage jobs seamlessly.
