# Backup Solutions for UCR Researchers

Ensuring the security, durability, and longevity of research data is a pivotal aspect of successful research projects at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). Recognizing the importance of data backups, UCR provides various backup solutions tailored to the diverse needs of our research community. Additionally, it's essential to note that all our storage systems are designed with high durability and resilience to ensure data integrity and availability.

## Cloud Storage Options

### GCS Glacier and AWS Glacier

UCR researchers have access to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Glacier and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Glacier at specially negotiated UC Educational Discount Program (EDP) rates. These services are optimized for the long-term archival of large datasets requiring infrequent access but essential preservation for future research, compliance, and verification purposes.

- **High Durability and Resilience:** Both GCS Glacier and AWS Glacier provide robust data protection with 99.999999999% durability, ensuring data is securely stored and protected against loss.
- **Seamless Integration:** Researchers can integrate these services directly through built-in NAS integration, storage gateways, or utilizing "rclone" software for data management.
- **Cost-Effective:** With UCR's EDP rates, these archival services offer an affordable solution for managing and preserving extensive data archives.

### Endpoint Backup: CrashPlan

CrashPlan is recommended for endpoint data backup, offering comprehensive data protection for devices such as laptops and desktops. This ensures that critical research data is securely backed up and recoverable in the event of device failure, loss, or theft.

- **Continuous Protection:** CrashPlan provides automatic, continuous backups and encryption, safeguarding your data around the clock.
- **User-Friendly:** The intuitive interface makes managing backups and restoring data straightforward, minimizing downtime and enhancing research productivity.

## Getting Started with Backup Solutions

1. **Contact ITS:** To explore these backup solutions, start by contacting UCR's Information Technology Solutions (ITS) for a consultation.
2. **MOU and Account Setup:** For cloud storage options, an MOU will outline service terms, including EDP rates. ITS will assist in account setup or migration.
3. **Recharge FAU:** Provide your funding information to facilitate service setup.
4. **Install and Configure Backup Solutions:** ITS will guide you through installing CrashPlan and configuring cloud storage solutions for optimal data protection.

## Emphasizing Durability and Resilience

While backups are crucial, it's worth highlighting that UCR's storage systems are inherently designed for high durability and resilience. These systems ensure that your data remains accessible and intact, even in the face of hardware malfunctions or environmental threats. By combining our durable and resilient storage solutions with comprehensive backup strategies, UCR researchers can have complete confidence in the security and availability of their valuable research data.
