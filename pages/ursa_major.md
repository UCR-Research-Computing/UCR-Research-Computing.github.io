## Ursa Major

**Modern Research requires advanced computing and data management resources** 

The University of California, Riverside is proud to announce its latest partnership with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), code-named Ursa Major, designed to provide the research computing support and resources necessary for our researchers to advance their work and unlock new opportunities for innovation and growth.

Through Ursa Major, UCR's researchers will have access to the following new and exciting services:

- **[Research Workstations](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Research_Workstations.md)**: Researchers can access high-performance workstations with ample memory and CPU or storage capabilities.
- **[Auto-scaling HPC Clusters](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_HPC_Clusters.md)**: Researchers can access cutting-edge high-performance computing clusters, equipped with the latest CPUs, GPUs, and large memory configurations.
- **[Research AI and Machine Learning Services](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Research_Services.md)**: Researchers can leverage Vertex.ai, Google's AI and Machine Learning platform, as well as other services, to support their research endeavors.
- **[Secure Research Storage](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Research_Storage.md)**: Researchers will have access to secure and optimized storage solutions, ensuring the safekeeping of their valuable research data.

This partnership with Google Cloud Platform is a major milestone for UCR, representing a significant investment in the future of research at our university. Our Research Computing Team is committed to providing a secure research computing infrastructure and research support services that will drive increased research output, grant funding, campus income, and prestige. This, in turn, will lead to the hiring of new faculty, positioning UCR as a leading R1 research university.

#### Ursa Major Resource Allocations

UCR's strategic approach to Ursa Major resource allocation ensures equitable access for researchers, prioritizing projects with significant potential for impact. The framework supports both high-value and exploratory projects through a tiered system, optimizing cloud resource distribution and enhancing research capabilities.

- **Tiered System**: Allocates resources based on project specifics, such as impact, maturity, and funding.
- **Resource Quotas**: Custom quotas for compute and storage, adjusted for efficiency and project needs.
- **Monitoring and Optimization**: Continuous review of resource use to maximize efficiency and support diverse research needs.

## **How to Begin:**

Submit your Ursa Major resource allocation request through our **[Allocation Form](https://forms.gle/GDbr5FbPjykAvB3N8)**. The Research Computing Team will review your project's allocation requet and available resources to approve your allocation. Once approved, you will receive an email with your allocation details and you can begin using your resources.

#### Leveraging Cloud Computing for Research:

Ursa Major is a testament to UCR's commitment to harnessing the power of cloud computing for research. Through this initiative, researchers can:

- **Access Scalable Resources**: Instantly scale computing resources to match project demands without the need for upfront hardware investments.
- **Accelerate Research Outcomes**: Utilize state-of-the-art computational tools and platforms to significantly reduce the time from research conception to publication.
- **Collaborate Globally**: Facilitate seamless collaboration with researchers worldwide through cloud-based platforms, breaking down geographical and institutional barriers.
- **Secure Data Management**: Benefit from robust security protocols and compliance measures inherent in cloud platforms, ensuring the safety and integrity of research data.
