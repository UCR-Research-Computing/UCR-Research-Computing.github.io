## Ursa Major: The Future of Cloud at UCR

Ursa Major is a strategic partnership between the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This initiative is currently undergoing a **strategic realignment** (Project Polaris) to ensure that UCR’s cloud footprint is optimized for high-impact research, data security, and long-term financial sustainability.

The goal of Ursa Major is to provide researchers with a "Fine Dining" experience—offering curated, high-performance resources where they are needed most, while ensuring that standard computational tasks are aligned with the most cost-effective campus infrastructure.

### Ursa Major Specialized Resources

Through Ursa Major, UCR researchers can leverage cloud-native capabilities that complement our on-premise infrastructure:

- **[Vertex AI & Machine Learning](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Research_Services.md)**: Utilize Google’s flagship AI platform for model training, Generative AI (LLMs), and vector-based research applications.
- **[Secure Research Enclaves](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Research_Workstations.md)**: Access specialized virtual workstations designed for P4/Restricted data compliance (e.g., HIPAA, NIST 800-171) in a high-security cloud environment.
- **[Petabyte-Scale Analytics](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Research_Storage.md)**: Leverage BigQuery for massive dataset analysis and high-throughput data warehousing.
- **[Strategic Archive Tier](../Knowledge_Base/Ursa_Major_Research_Storage.md)**: Utilize cost-effective, long-term cloud storage for grant compliance and large-scale data retention.

### Ursa Major Resource Allocation Framework (Proposed)

UCR utilizes a tiered framework to ensure equitable and strategic access to cloud resources. This framework is designed to support the unique funding cycles of academic research while maintaining institutional governance.

#### Allocation Tiers

*   **Explore Tier:** Provides a baseline level of resources for researchers new to the cloud or conducting small-scale exploratory experiments. This tier is intended to facilitate testing and code development before moving to larger-scale production environments.
*   **Advanced Tier (Strategic Allocation):** Designed for high-impact projects with specialized technical requirements (e.g., GenAI, large-scale BigQuery, or Regulated Data). Access to this tier is granted through a proposal review process to ensure the cloud is the most appropriate and sustainable destination for the workload.
*   **Researcher-Focused Subscription Tier:** This tier allows PIs to leverage their own grant funding to provision dedicated GCP environments. This model is designed to support high-scale workloads (e.g., massive GPU clusters, AI training) while utilizing UCR’s negotiated enterprise-grade security and support.

#### **Monitoring & Optimization**

To ensure efficient use of campus resources, the Research Computing team provides continuous monitoring and optimization for all Ursa Major projects. Researchers can access usage insights through the following standard dashboards:

| Dashboard | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Cloud Storage Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/resourceList/gcs_bucket) | Insights into storage utilization and data transfer. |
| [Infrastructure Summary](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/summary/infrastructure) | High-level overview of active cloud resources. |
| [VM Management](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/resourceList/gce_instance) | Performance and usage tracking for virtual instances. |
| [Allocation Spend](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/019E1F-BADE9B-60248B/reports) | *In Development*: Future dashboard for budgetary tracking. |
