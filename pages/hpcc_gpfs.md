# HPCC GPFS

The High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC) at UCR features GPFS (General Parallel File System), providing researchers with high-speed, parallel computing storage. This infrastructure supports compute-intensive tasks and large-scale data analysis, making it an essential resource for advanced research requiring significant computational power and storage capacity.

This storage solution is used within the High-Performance Computing Center here on Campus and is the main research storage platform. It is a High-Speed Parallel files system connected to the Campus cluster via 56 GB/s Infiniband capable of expanding to 100's of PetaBytes in size.


Space Available: 100's of TBs

Accessibility: Windows, Mac/Apple, Web Browsers, Linux Command Line, Smart Phones, and Globus.
