# Security

At the University of California, Riverside (UCR), ensuring the security of research data is a priority. We work closely with UCR's Information Security Team to provide comprehensive consulting services on securing your research projects. Our goal is to ensure that all research activities meet the highest standards of data security, complying with relevant regulations and university policies.

## Our Services

We assist researchers in several key areas:

- **Understanding Your Research**: We delve into the specifics of your research to identify any applicable regulations, requirements, and necessary controls.
- **Data Security Plan (DSP)**: We aid in developing a Data Security Plan for your project. The DSP outlines Roles, Responsibilities, Policies, Processes, and Controls essential for safeguarding your data.
- **Implementation**: Our team is here to help implement the plans or controls developed, ensuring your research data is secure.

We encourage researchers to connect with the Research Computing Team to explore how we can support your data security needs.

## Resources

- **Data Security Plan Template**: A template designed for use at UCR to facilitate the creation of comprehensive Data Security Plans.
- **Protection Level Classification**: UC's established classifications for the protection level of information and IT resources, guiding researchers on the security measures needed for their data.
- **Cloud Services Protection Level Handout**: An overview of the protection levels applicable to cloud services, ensuring researchers choose the right platforms for their data security requirements.

## Computing Resources and Security
