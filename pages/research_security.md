## Research Security

At the University of California, Riverside (UCR), ensuring the security of research data is a priority. We work closely with UCR's Information Security Team to provide comprehensive consulting services on securing your research projects. Our goal is to ensure that all research activities meet the highest standards of data security, complying with relevant regulations and university policies.

We assist researchers in several key areas:

- **Understanding Your Research**: We delve into the specifics of your research to identify any applicable regulations, requirements, and necessary controls.
- **Data Security Plan**: We aid in developing a Data Security Plan for your project. The DSP outlines Roles, Responsibilities, Policies, Processes, and Controls essential for safeguarding your data.
- **Implementation**: Our team is here to help implement the plans or controls developed, ensuring your research data is secure.

We encourage researchers to connect with the Research Computing Team to explore how we can support your data security needs.

#### Resources

- **[UCR Data Security Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oO97C_AtGzAsno6se8MYcZlqfiv3BpvPurFnVosi_0/edit?usp=sharing)**: A template designed for use at UCR to facilitate the creation of comprehensive Data Security Plans.
- **[UC Data Protection Level Classification](https://security.ucop.edu/policies/institutional-information-and-it-resource-classification.html)**: UC's established classifications for the protection level of information and IT resources, guiding researchers on the security measures needed for their data.
- **[Cloud Services Protection Level Handout](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SFxCeJL0GebFgBNwvwda37ucCHx5Is__/view?usp=sharing)**: An overview of the protection levels applicable to cloud services, ensuring researchers choose the right platforms for their data security requirements.

#### Security Policies and Regulations

Understanding and adhering to security policies and regulations is critical for safeguarding research data. Our team provides guidance on key standards including:

- **[CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Model/)**: A framework designed to protect the defense industrial base from cybersecurity threats. CMMC outlines a comprehensive range of cybersecurity standards and best practices to ensure the security and resilience of defense-related information and technologies.
- **[UC IS-3](http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000543/BFB-IS-3)**: The University of California's policy on information security, which sets forth the standards for protecting institutional and personal information across all UC campuses. This policy mandates a proactive approach to information security management, risk assessment, and incident response.
- **[NIST 800-171](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/what-nist-sp-800-171-and-who-needs-follow-it-0)**: Provides guidelines for protecting controlled unclassified information (CUI) in non-federal systems and organizations. NIST 800-171 is critical for research projects that handle sensitive information, ensuring that data security practices align with federal standards for information confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **[NSPM-33](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-united-states-government-supported-research-development-national-security-policy/)**: A National Security Presidential Memorandum focused on improving the security of systems related to National Security, Defense, and the Intelligence Community. NSPM-33 emphasizes the importance of securing research and development activities against espionage, theft, and exploitation.

Adherence to these standards is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of research activities at UCR. Our dedicated team is available to assist researchers in understanding these regulations and implementing the necessary security measures to comply with them. For more guidance or to discuss how these standards apply to your research, please reach out to our support team.
