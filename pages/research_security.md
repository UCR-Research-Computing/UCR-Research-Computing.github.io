## Research Security

At the University of California, Riverside (UCR), ensuring the security of research data is a priority. We work closely with UCR's Information Security Team to provide comprehensive consulting services on securing your research projects. Our goal is to ensure that all research activities meet the highest standards of data security, complying with relevant regulations and university policies.

We assist researchers in several key areas:

- **Understanding Your Research Security**: We delve into the specifics of your research to identify any applicable regulations, requirements, and necessary controls.
- **Data Security Plan**: We aid in developing a Data Security Plan for your project. The DSP outlines Roles, Responsibilities, Policies, Processes, and Controls essential for safeguarding your data.
- **Implementation**: Our team is here to help implement the plans or controls developed, ensuring your research data is secure.

We encourage researchers to connect with the Research Computing Team to explore how we can support your data security needs.

#### Understanding your Research Security

Understanding and adhering to security policies and regulations is critical for safeguarding research data at UCR. All research data falls under a classification of security level ranging from P1 to P4, refer to the detailed descriptions of each level on the UCOP Security Classification page: [UCOP Information Security Classification Standards](https://security.ucop.edu/policies/institutional-information-and-it-resource-classification.html):
- **P1/P2** involving data without Personal Identifiable Information (PII)—P1 being public and P2 internal.
- **P3/P4** categories deal with data containing PII, necessitating a [Security Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oO97C_AtGzAsno6se8MYcZlqfiv3BpvPurFnVosi_0/edit?usp=sharing), where P3 is classified as sensitive and P4 as confidential.

By default, the systems we build and manage at UCR Research Computing are designed to comply with the UC IS-3 policy at the P2 level, ensuring a robust foundation for data security and integrity. While our infrastructure supports projects up to P4 level, accommodating the highest levels of data sensitivity, it is important to note that we do not support the handling of US classified data.

Our team provides guidance on key standards including, but not limited to, the UC IS-3 policy, external regulations from data providers, and state and federal guidelines. Here is an overview of the frameworks we adhere to and guide our research community in complying with:

- **UC IS-3**: As part of the UC system, we adhere to the [University of California's policy on information security](http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000543/BFB-IS-3), setting forth standards for protecting institutional and personal information across all UC campuses. This internal policy mandates a proactive approach to information security management, risk assessment, and incident response.
- **External Requirements**: Beyond the UC's internal IS-3 policy, research projects may need to comply with external security requirements from specific data providers (e.g., Cal-Edison, Department of Education), state health departments, or regulations like NIST-800-171 and CMMC. These are crucial for projects that involve data from outside entities with their own security policies.
    - **[CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Model/)**: Protects the defense industrial base from cybersecurity threats. It outlines cybersecurity standards and best practices for defense-related information and technologies.    
    - **[NIST 800-171](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/what-nist-sp-800-171-and-who-needs-follow-it-0)**: Guidelines for protecting controlled unclassified information (CUI) in non-federal systems, ensuring data security practices align with federal standards.    
    - **[NSPM-33](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-united-states-government-supported-research-development-national-security-policy/)**: Focuses on securing systems related to National Security, Defense, and the Intelligence Community against espionage and theft.
    
Adherence to these standards is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of research activities at UCR. Our team is available to assist researchers in understanding these regulations and implementing the necessary security measures to comply with them. For more guidance or to discuss how these standards apply to your research, please reach out to our support team.

#### Data Security Plan (DSP)

At UCR Research Computing, we understand the critical importance of safeguarding your research data. To this end, we offer assistance in developing a **Data Security Plan (DSP)** tailored to your project's specific needs. A DSP is a comprehensive document that outlines the Roles, Responsibilities, Policies, Processes, and Controls essential for the protection of your data. It serves as a blueprint to ensure that your research is conducted securely, in compliance with relevant standards, and with the utmost safety.

For research projects classified under **P3** and **P4** levels—which involve sensitive data containing **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)** necessitating a security plan—we adhere to a detailed template to guide the creation of your DSP. This template is designed with the aim of securing the highest levels of data sensitivity and ensuring compliance with both internal and external security requirements.

#### **[UCR Data Security Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oO97C_AtGzAsno6se8MYcZlqfiv3BpvPurFnVosi_0/edit?usp=sharing):** Our template facilitates the creation of Data Security Plans at UCR, providing a structured approach to identify and mitigate risks associated with handling sensitive data. 

> For projects classified under **P1** and **P2** levels, which involve data without Personal Identifiable Information (PII), **nothing is requiered**. We are building a streamlined and modified version of the DSP template. This adaptation reflects the reduced risk and security requirements associated with these levels of data sensitivity.

Our commitment at UCR Research Computing extends to collaborating closely with your lab and the UCR Information Security Office (ISO) team. This collaboration ensures that we provide comprehensive support in planning and conducting your secure research as smoothly and efficiently as possible.
