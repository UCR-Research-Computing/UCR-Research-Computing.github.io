## UCR's Ceph-Based Research Storage Solution

UC Riverside is excited to introduce a significant enhancement to our research infrastructure: the Ceph-Based Central Campus Research Storage Solution. Funded by an NSF CC* grant, this initiative aims to provide scalable, resilient, and flexible storage tailored to the diverse needs of our research community.

### Secure Central Campus Research Storage

- **Scalable Storage**: 2.2PB of usable storage, integrating 20% with the NRP Nautilus cluster for advanced data processing.
- **Wide Connectivity**: Secure connections via NFS, CIFS, and S3 interfaces to various devices and systems.
- **Cost-Effective**: Base allocations from 200GB to 10TB at no cost, with additional storage at $30 per TB per year.

### Distribution Strategy

To ensure fair access among UCR’s 800-1000 research faculty:

- **Base Allocation**: Equitable initial storage allocation, adjustable based on research demands.
- **Merit and Need-Based Allocation**: Applications reviewed for scope, data needs, and impact.
- **Affordable Expansion**: Options to purchase additional storage at a nominal rate.

### Enhancements and Integrations

- **Nautilus Integration**: Seamless data transfer with a 100G connection via CENIC’s CalREN network.
- **Federated Identities**: Secure access management using Shibboleth and CILogon, promoting collaboration within the Pacific Research Platform.

### Cybersecurity Measures

A comprehensive strategy featuring:

- **Layered Security Model**: Incorporates encryption and network segmentation.
- **Regular Assessments**: To ensure adherence to IS-3 Standards and safeguard data integrity.

### Performance and Training

- **Benchmarking**: To measure storage performance and system adoption.
- **Training Sessions**: Scheduled soon after system launch, with ongoing workshops and resources.

### Future Plans

- **Strategic Expansion**: Consideration for network and storage capability enhancements.
- **Resilience and Redundancy**: Emphasis on system reliability and data accessibility.
