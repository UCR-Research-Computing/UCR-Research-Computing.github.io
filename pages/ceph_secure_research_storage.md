# Ceph-Based Central Campus Research Storage Solution

The University of California, Riverside (UCR) is thrilled to announce an upcoming significant enhancement to our research computing infrastructure: the **Ceph-Based Central Campus Research Storage Solution**. This initiative, funded by an NSF CC* grant, is set to provide a scalable, resilient, and flexible storage solution designed to meet the diverse needs of our research community.

## Key Features

- **Use Case:** Offers a scalable, resilient, and flexible storage solution for a wide range of research needs.
- **Capacity:** Boasts 2.2PB of usable storage, with 20% integrated with the NRP Nautilus cluster for enhanced data processing capabilities.
- **Connectivity:** Seamlessly connects to researchers' laptops, servers, storage systems, and research equipment, all securely through NFS, CIFS, and S3 interfaces.
- **Cost:** Provides base allocations ranging from 200GB to 10TB at no cost, with additional storage available at $30 per TB per year.

## Distribution Strategy

Given UCR's research faculty numbers approximately 800-1000 members, a fair and equitable distribution strategy is essential:

### Base Allocation Scenario

- Each faculty member receives an equal base amount of storage, with potential adjustments based on specific research needs and project scale.
- Initial equitable distribution offers each faculty member approximately 1TB to 1.5TB of storage.

### Merit and Need-Based Allocation

- Additional allocations beyond the base amount are governed by an application process, evaluating the project's scope, data requirements, and potential research impact.

### Cost for Additional Storage

- Faculties seeking to expand their storage allocation beyond the initial provision can do so by covering the additional cost of $30 per TB per year.
- Funds generated from paid storage subscriptions contribute to a dedicated fund for system sustainability, refresh, and expansion.

## Benefits

This Ceph-based storage solution ensures flexibility and scalability, catering to the evolving storage needs of diverse research projects. By providing a robust infrastructure for data storage, UCR aims to support the research lifecycle at every stage, enabling seamless collaboration, ensuring data compliance, and fostering an environment where research can thrive without constraints.
