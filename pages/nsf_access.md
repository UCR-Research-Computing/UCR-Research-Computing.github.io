### About ACCESS
ACCESS, funded by the NSF, offers a broad spectrum of advanced computing systems and services at no cost, aiming to democratize access to computational resources. It stands on the foundation laid by the XSEDE project, expanding the ecosystem with innovative capabilities and broader participation.

#### What ACCESS Provides
- **Systems and Services**: From supercomputers to specialized compute clusters with diverse capabilities.
- **Data and Storage Services**: Secure and scalable solutions for research data.
- **Expertise and Support**: Assistance to utilize resources effectively and achieve research goals.
- **Scientific Applications and Gateways**: Specialized software and interfaces to streamline research workflows.
- **Education and Training**: Workshops, courses, and resources for skill development.

#### Eligibility
U.S. researchers, educators, students, and international collaborators are eligible to use ACCESS resources, adhering to NSF and ACCESS policies. Commercial organizations may also qualify under specific policies.

#### Do You Need to Be an Expert?
No. ACCESS provides support to accommodate various levels of computing needs, from basic to advanced requirements.

### Examples of ACCESS Usage
- Scaling applications beyond personal computing limits.
- Learning best practices in scientific software development.
- Accessing GPUs for machine learning in diverse research fields.
- Engaging in code optimization and high-performance computing classes.

### Project Types
There are four different project types to choose from: Explore, Discover, Accelerate, and Maximize. And if you’re not sure, you can always start with an Explore project and upgrade as you learn more about your resource needs. Even if you know you’ll eventually need a Maximize project, you can begin with a smaller project so you can get started while you wait for the next semi-annual round of Maximize proposals to be reviewed. The table below compares the key features of each of the different project types.

- **EXPLORE** : Great for resource evaluation, graduate student projects, small classes and training events, benchmarking, code development and porting, and similar small-scale uses.

- **DISCOVER** : Designed for research grants with modest resource needs, Campus Champions, large classes and training events, NSF graduate fellowships, benchmarking and code testing at scale, and gateway development.

- **ACCELERATE** : Best for experienced users with mid-scale resource needs, consolidating multi-grant programs, collaborative projects, preparing for Maximize ACCESS requests, and gateways with growing communities.

- **MAXIMIZE** : The choice for large-scale research activities that need more resources than the limit for Accelerate ACCESS projects.

### Cost
ACCESS resources and services are generally free for academic and research purposes, with certain exceptions for commercial use.

### Limits and Allocation Requests
Before running large computations, users must submit allocation requests to detail their computational needs.

### How to Acknowledge ACCESS
When including ACCESS in funding proposals or research materials, specific language is provided to ensure proper acknowledgment of the resources utilized.
