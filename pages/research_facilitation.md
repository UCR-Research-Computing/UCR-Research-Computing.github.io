## Research Computing Facilitation

At the University of California, Riverside (UCR), Research Computing Facilitation is a cornerstone service designed to empower our researchers by providing comprehensive support and expertise in the use of advanced computing resources. Following the lead of other Association of American Universities (AAU) and R1 institutions, UCR is committed to enhancing the capability, efficiency, and impact of research through cutting-edge computational technologies and support services.

### What is Research Computing Facilitation?

Research Computing Facilitation refers to the suite of services and support mechanisms aimed at helping researchers access, utilize, and optimize high-performance computing (HPC), cloud computing, and other advanced digital research tools. It encompasses a broad range of activities, from initial consultation and project planning to ongoing support and optimization of research workflows.

#### Key Components

- **Consultation and Planning**: Offering expert advice to researchers to identify the most appropriate computational resources for their projects.
- **Training and Education**: Providing workshops, tutorials, and documentation to equip researchers with the necessary skills to effectively utilize computing resources.
- **Technical Support and Optimization**: Assisting researchers with technical issues, software installations, and optimizing computational workflows for efficiency.
- **Access to Advanced Resources**: Facilitating access to HPC facilities, cloud services, and specialized computing infrastructure tailored to research needs.

#### Collaborative Engagement

Our facilitators work closely with researchers to understand their specific needs and challenges. This partnership approach ensures that computational solutions are seamlessly integrated into research projects, enhancing their scope and impact.
