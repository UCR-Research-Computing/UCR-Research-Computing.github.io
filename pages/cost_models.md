# Cost Models

We prioritize strategic alignment with our university's mission and the practical needs of accessing computational resources. Our funding support and cost models are designed to advance research by providing equitable access to state-of-the-art computational tools. Drawing from industry best practices and our strategic objectives, we have crafted a cost model framework that caters to the diverse requirements of our dynamic research community.

Our model offers a variety of funding support and cost options to facilitate research endeavors across all disciplines. These options include System-Wide Discounted Rates, UCR Subsidized Access, the Condo Model for shared resources, No-Cost Access for specific initiatives, and Direct Cost Options for project-specific funding. This approach ensures flexibility, promoting the efficient use of resources and supporting a range of research activities, from nascent inquiries to extensive, data-driven projects.


## NSF-Based Resources (No Cost)

* [ACCESS Program](nsf-access.md): Provides no-cost access to advanced computing systems and services, funded by the NSF.
