# Computing and Research Infrastructure Support

## Overview


## Research Computing System Administration Service (RCSAS)

The [Research Computing System Administration Service](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eD8p5CLpMsq6gdfAoHnx_xoY0i_3Ovha2IBrEhiYaIo/edit?usp=sharing) at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) is designed to support faculty and researchers by administering research computing systems. Authored by Chuck Forsyth, this initiative aims to consolidate campus research system support to enhance security, reliability, and innovation.

## Key Highlights

- **Purpose:** To design, construct, and administer research computing systems for UCR faculty, enhancing security and innovation.
- **Scope:** Includes designing research systems, meeting security standards, managing assets, and more. Out-of-scope activities include providing backups and hardware hosting.
- **Responsibilities:** Divided between Research Computing and researchers, covering system design, software management, troubleshooting, etc.
- **Stakeholders:** Includes Charles Greer, Assoc. Vice Chancellor for Research; Chuck Forsyth, Associate Director of Research Computing; among others.

## Objectives

### Business/Research Objectives

- Make RCSAS available to all UCR faculty and researchers.
- Support research, research systems, and computing workflow.
- Reduce system administration overhead, allowing researchers to focus on research.
- Secure campus research systems, reducing risks.

### Technology Objectives

- Use standardized hardware and software approaches for system design and construction.
- Ensure research systems meet at least IS-3 P2 Security controls.
- Provide scalable support through administration tools and knowledge bases.

## Activities

### In-Scope Activities

- Design and construct research systems.
- Meet or exceed UC Security Level P2 standards.
- Standardize identity, access management, and software management.

### Out-of-Scope Activities

- Backup services.
- Configuration to meet IS-3 P4 control standards without a separate MOU.
- Provision of new or replacement hardware.

## Getting Started

For researchers interested in utilizing RCSAS, the process involves:

1. **Contact Research Computing:** Begin by reaching out to Chuck Forsyth or the designated research system contact.
2. **Evaluate Your Needs:** Discuss your research requirements and how RCSAS can support your objectives.
3. **Engage in the Service:** Participate in the MOU, defining the scope and expectations for the service.

RCSAS is a pivotal resource for UCR researchers, streamlining the administration of research computing systems to bolster security and innovation across campus research endeavors.
