# NRP Nautilus Cluster

## Introduction

The Nautilus Cluster is a key component of the National Research Platform (NRP), a collaborative initiative led by researchers at UC San Diego, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and UC Berkeley. Supported by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, the NRP aims to provide specialized IT infrastructure to foster scientific exploration and discovery.

## Nautilus Cluster Overview

Nautilus, a HyperCluster designed for running containerized Big Data applications, leverages Kubernetes (K8S) for managing applications and Rook for Ceph data services automation. It features CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and a federated national-scale CDN, offering diverse computational resources for various tasks.

- **Access**: Users can access Nautilus using institutional credentials via CILogin.
- **Storage**: Includes a Home File System with 1.6 PB capacity and Data Cache with 50TB each.
