## UCR Research Computing Compute Resources

The University of California, Riverside (UCR) equips its research community with a comprehensive suite of computational resources to meet the varied demands of cutting-edge research. From local high-performance computing clusters to expansive national grid computing platforms and versatile cloud computing services, UCR ensures that researchers have the computational capabilities needed for their innovative projects.

### The 4-Tier GPU & Compute Offload Hierarchy
When advanced compute or GPU workloads exceed the subsidized Tier 1 limits of our cloud environments, researchers are guided through a strategic 4-tier hierarchy to maximize the return on local infrastructure investments before utilizing national resources:

#### 1. High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC) - Primary Offload
UCR's HPCC is the preferred local destination for high-performance computing, equipped with thousands of CPUs and GPUs designed for demanding computational tasks and data analysis projects.
- **Access for**: UCR faculty, researchers, and graduate students.
- **Cost Model**: $1,000/year Flat Rate per Lab.
- [Learn more about HPCC](HPCC.md)

#### 2. Nautilus & Pacific Research Platform - Secondary
Nautilus enables fast data transfer and collaborative research, serving as a regional/national Kubernetes grid leveraging UCR hardware contributions. It is the best destination for containerized workloads that overflow the local HPCC.
- **For**: Researchers in collaborative projects within the Pacific Research Platform.
- [Learn about Nautilus](Nautilus.md)

#### 3. NAIRR Pilot (National AI Resource) - Tertiary
For specialized, high-end AI allocations when local/regional capacity is insufficient (e.g., massive H100 arrays, exotic accelerators like Cerebras or SambaNova).
- **Cost**: Free (Competitive Proposal).
- [Learn about NAIRR Pilot](../Knowledge_Base/KB008_Using_NAIRR_Pilot.md)

#### 4. NSF ACCESS - Quaternary
The ACCESS program provides UCR researchers with access to traditional national supercomputing grids reserved for massive-scale jobs requiring thousands of compute nodes.
- **Application**: Through the NSF.
