# Contributing to UCR Research Computing Documentation

We welcome contributions to enhance and improve our documentation! To maintain consistency and clarity, please adhere to the following content strategy.

## Content Directory Structure

This documentation site is organized into two main content directories: `pages` and `Knowledge_Base`. Understanding the purpose of each will help you place your content appropriately.

### `/pages` Directory

**Purpose:** This directory is for high-level, often more static, information that provides overviews, defines services, or outlines strategic information. It's the primary entry point for users trying to understand *what* resources are available and *why* they are important.

**Content Types:**

*   **About Us/Mission:** Information about the Research Computing group, its mission, and strategic goals.
*   **Service Overviews:** Main landing pages for significant services or initiatives (e.g., HPCC, Ursa Major, Nautilus). These pages should:
    *   Describe the service and its benefits.
    *   Outline eligibility or access requirements.
    *   Provide links to relevant `Knowledge_Base` articles for specific "how-to" guides or technical details.
    *   Link to official external sites if applicable.
*   **Resource Summaries:** Pages that aggregate information about groups of resources (e.g., computing resources overview, storage options overview).
*   **Policies:** Official policy documents related to research computing resources.
*   **Contact Information:** Central contact points.

### `/Knowledge_Base` Directory

**Purpose:** This directory is for practical, detailed "how-to" information. It helps users understand *how* to use specific services, tools, or troubleshoot problems. The content here is often more granular and task-oriented.

**Content Types:**

*   **How-To Guides:** Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks (e.g., "How to Launch an Ursa Major Cluster," "Connecting to a Research Workstation").
*   **Technical Specifications:** Detailed technical information about systems or services that would be too granular for a `pages` overview.
*   **FAQs:** Frequently Asked Questions related to specific services, tools, or common issues.
*   **Troubleshooting Guides:** Information to help users diagnose and resolve common problems.
*   **Software/Tool Documentation:** Specifics on using particular software available on research computing platforms.
*   **Links to External Vendor Documentation:** When appropriate, link to official vendor guides for comprehensive technical details.

### Root `README.md`

The `README.md` file in the root of the repository serves as the main welcome page. It should:

*   Provide a brief introduction to UCR Research Computing.
*   Offer high-level navigation, primarily linking to key overview pages in the `/pages` directory.
*   Include a prominent link to the `/Knowledge_Base/README.md` as the entry point for users seeking how-to guides and technical documentation.

## Tone and Style

Please strive for a professional, informative, and helpful tone in all documentation. Language should be clear, concise, and accessible to a broad audience of researchers, including those who may not be experts in a particular computing domain. Avoid overly colloquial language or excessive promotional phrasing.

By following these guidelines, we can create a cohesive and user-friendly documentation site for the UCR research community.
